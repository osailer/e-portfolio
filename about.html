      <h2 class="section-title">Goals</h2>
      <p>I’m looking for a place where I feel needed, appreciated, and able to make a meaningful impact. I’ve always been passionate about learning as much as I can so I can grow and expand my skill set. I value organizations that invest in their staff and make their people feel important.

      </p><p>I want to continue growing my knowledge in Cybersecurity and System Administration so I can build a strong foundation and pursue a long-term career in those fields.</p>
